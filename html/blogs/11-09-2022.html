    <h1 class="write big">Advice on Master's Applications</h1>
    <div class = "blogcontent exo">
        <p> I get a lot of questions regarding master's applications. I won't be giving the general advice here,
            that stuff is available through a number of channels. Here is some specific stuff that I wish someone 
            had told me before I started.
       </p>
       <h1>Choosing where to apply:</h1>
       <p>
        As per my experience, the colleges I got into heavily depended on what
         colleges my seniors got into. For example, I don't know if anyone from 
         IIIT-H has actually gone to UMich in the past, but I still applied because 
         I heard someone had gotten accepted there. 
        Note: Just because none of your seniors got in doesn't mean you won't! Just be aware of these factors when choosing, and be sure to include colleges you know for a fact will have taken IIIT-H students in the past.
       </p>
       <h1>Statement of Purpose:</h1>
       <p>
        Many people's SOPs, even mine, have some kind of "story" at the beginning. I saw all my seniors doing it, so I did it. Does it really work? Idk. To be on the safe side, you can include it, but make sure it's not too unbelievable. And don't waste too many words on it.
       </p><p>
Try to organise your SOP into paragraphs, with each talking about a single project/experience. It's not necessary to include every single thing you ever did in your SOP! Prioritise quality. Here's an absolutely excellent SOP writing tip I got from a senior: for each project/element in your SOP add the following points:
What you learnt from the project
</p><p>
How you, individually contributed to the project (Avoid using the word "we" too much when describing your projects)
<p>
What were the challenges you faced? 
<br>
Optimise your SOP to include keywords mentioned on the college website. Also check the college websites to see if they have anything for "prospective students".
<p></p><p>
Start writing early! Cutting down words gets really hard later on. Plus, sitting for the first time and putting everything down is daunting, but just dive in! Your first draft will be crappy. Just refine, refine, refine! Try to get as many people to review it as you can: friends, family, seniors anyone literally anyone helps. 
</p>
    <p>
Also some colleges call the SoP "Personal Statement". Some colleges ask for both! Carefully read the prompt of what they are asking for, and be sure to answer EVERY question they are asking. This may differ from college to college. 
</p><p>

Obviously most colleges ask for: why a master's, what's the future plan, how will this help you etc. Even if it's just one line, be very clear and specific about this. See senior's SoPs for inspiration on what to add here.
</p><p>

Another question is: why do you feel this program is a right fit etc. For every college, what I did was
Mention two courses which interested me and fit in with my described future direction
Mention two profs and their specific works which I am interested in, with whom I would love to work/do a project type of thing
If applicable, talk about the particular specialization/track that the college has which I wanted to take.
This sort of shows you've done your research and customised your SoP for their college.
